<!-- ABOUT THE REPO -->
<h2 align="left">About</h2>
<p align="left">
&emsp;Some or none of you may know that I have a “nerdy” hobby. I love watching and playing D&D. I especially love watching Critical Role, which is a bunch of nerdy voice actors that play dungeons and dragons. (cue Travis’ “DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS”) While I have been doing natural language processing homework I have had Campaign 3 playing in the background. This sparked a lot of project ideas that answer certain questions I have.
