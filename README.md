<!-- ABOUT THE REPO -->
<h2 align="left">About The this repo</h2>
<p align="center">
Some or none of you may know that I have a “nerdy” hobby. I love watching and playing D&D. I especially love watching Critical Role, which is a bunch of nerdy voice actors that play dungeons and dragons. (cue Travis’ “DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS”) While I have been doing natural language processing homework I have had Campaign 3 playing in the background. This sparked a lot of project ideas that answer certain questions I have.

<h3 align="left">Are Laura Bailey’s Characters from all three campaigns really all that different?</h3>
Laura Bailey’s characters and quirky personality on screen is my favorite. She has played a lot of different personas on the show, so I wanted to know how similar the language she uses for each character is. 

<h3 align="left">What happened in the episode?</h3>
The episodes are about four to four and a half hours long. That is a lot of time to spend watching something, so I wanted to know how well an LDA model can describe what happened and if it can tell me the order of which the topics happen.
